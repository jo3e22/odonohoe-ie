## Why I am developing this project
This repository contains all the files for a static webpage I have been developing as a person project to develop my knowledge and experience in new languages including HTML, PHP, and JavaScript.

I am hoping to take on resposibility for managing the website and data for a sports society of which I am a member.  It has been developed in PHP using the Laravel framework, and serves as a source of information on upcoming competitions, as well as public record keeping, for its' approximately 200 members.

## Hosting
I am using the oppertunity to host this site on a linux-ubuntu server, growing my experience with networking protocols, DNS records, and Domain managment.
It can be found at james.odonohoe.ie (subject to maintanence and network outages), and soon to be at github.odonohoe.ie using github-pages to ensure consistant uptime for visitors.

## Cookies
I have included a cookies pop-up for this website.  I have been exploring how cookies can be used and applied, what information they can store and access, and what features could be developed as a result.  In line with UK law, the cookies pop-up does not prevent the guest from using the site, the options are equally visable, and no data is stored without informing the guest.
### What am I using cookies for?
The cookies are entirely optional, and will not limit the functionality of the website in anyway, it is purely an experiment with the feature for my own learning.  Personal details will never be sold or missused.
An example of what I may use cookies for is to track how anonymous users move through the website, i.e. which paths are most often followed.

## The Website
From the homepage, my CV can be downloaded.  There is a (curently blank) about me section, and an option to contact me, which securely stores the guests email and message on the host server.  This is a feature I wish to develop further in future with an automated email responce to the guest, as well as message forwarding to myself.
There is a search feature that has yet to be developed functionally, but has the groundwork layed.
### Mobile support and usability
I am attempting to improve the formatting and usability on mobile devices.  Currently there is scaling support and a differnt organsiation of the header, but there are improvememnts to be made.
### Fonts
By default the font used is OpenDyslexic.  I have chosen this partially for accesability, and partially for the purpose of developing an interesting feature, storing my own fonts locally and creating a toggle option that works seemlesly and intuatively.  The secondary font is Roboto.
